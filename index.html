<h2> First cartridges </h2>	
<p>  In the first weapon, gunpowder was poured into the barrel, then a wad consisting mainly of leather was rammed and then a bullet consisting of lead was poured and so that he would usefully shot it was fixed with another wad </p>
<h3 id="2"> Gun case </h3> 
<p>  Weapon sleeve - a thin-walled tube (glass) closed at one end, designed to place a propellant charge and means of ignition.The most important qualities of a weapon case are tightness, corrosion resistance, strength and ease of removing it from the chamber after a shot. Sleeves of cartridges for smooth-bore weapons often have a metal bottom and walls made of plastic or cardboard. </p>

<p> However, such a system did not exist in those years. The available samples, although representing, in theory, a significantly higher level of development of small arms compared to single-shot rifles common at that time as military weapons, had very significant general shortcomings, due to which they could not be accepted for mass arming of the regular army</p>
<p> But all of them also had stores equipped with one cartridge, and therefore they were almost never taken into full service as the only military model, usually remaining only an addition to single-shot rifles, which made up the bulk of the infantry weapons. Under normal circumstances, the shooter had to use them as single-shot ones, saving the supply of cartridges in the store at a critical moment of the battle, which is naturally extremely difficult to determine the onset  the same can be said about the so-called “convenience stores” and “loading boosters”, which were mounted on a single-shot rifle, turning it into a kind of magazine, but were cumbersome, relatively unreliable and difficult to operate, and equipped, again same, one cartridge. </p>

<p> Shops with military weapons for a long time remained constant, that is, constantly rigidly mounted on a rifle; interchangeable stores, as with modern weapons, were then considered completely unacceptable wastefulness. Even if the store could be removed for cleaning (as with the English Lee-Metford rifle), there was only one for the rifle (and in the case of the aforementioned Li-Metford rifle also joined it in a chain), respectively, the shooter could not have a stock of previously equipped stores. That is why the loading of the only one rifle magazine available for one shooter in those years was a critical drawback of magazine weapons that impeded its widespread military use. </p>
<br><p> The UMP submachine gun is loaded with three types of cartridges: the cartridge of the 45th, 40th and 9x19 mm Parabellum caliber. Despite the various calibers, all versions have the same design and differ only in the shape of the store. Also, this weapon has a free shutter. 
There is also a USC version - a self-loading carbine (civilian version) for self-defense or sports purposes. It differs from the main versions by a fixed skeletal stock, a 10-round magazine (incompatible with other low-loaded submachine gun stores), the absence of the possibility of automatic fire, and a longer barrel. </p>

<h3 > Glock 18</h3>
<br><p id="3"> Glock 18 is an Austrian automatic pistol manufactured by Glock GmbH with a caliber of 9 × 19 mm. Designed for arming special police units. Glock 18 was developed in 1986. Glock 18 was created on the basis of the Glock 17 pistol and is distinguished, first of all, by the presence of a translator of the shooting mode, which allows firing with single shots or bursts.
<br><p> In the latter case, the rate of fire is approximately 1200 rounds per minute. </p>
